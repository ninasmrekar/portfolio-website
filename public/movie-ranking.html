<h1>The Best Movies According to Nina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is in my humble opinion the best novel written by Jane Austen and the movie adaptation released in 2005 is my
    favourite adaption of the novel.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>There is no way I am picking only one Star Wars movie (I love all of the first six movies). These movies just
    have to be watched by anyone who loves sci-fi or fantasy.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>These movies are heartwarming and action-packed at the same time. They always remind me of childhood and of reading
    the books for the first time.</p>
